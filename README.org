#+TITLE: Christine Lemmer-Webber's emacs config

* Intro

Welcome to my .emacs config.  It's got some structure to it, but it's
kind of grown organically over the years.  Hopefully it's useful for
you.  Keep in mind, a lot of stuff in here is stuff that's probably
been around since I started using emacs and had no idea what I was
doing in 2003.  I clean it up occasionally, but uh... expect cruft.

So the way I install things currently is kind of goofy.  I used to
have multiple machines that all shared this config, but I mostly just
use my laptop these days.  Nonetheless, my .emacs looks more or less
like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Load up the general config
(load-file "~/.config/emacs/general.el")

;; El-get!  This installs a bunch of the modes I use
(load-file "~/.config/emacs/modes/elget.el")

;; Modes
(load-file "~/.config/emacs/modes/bbdb.el")
(load-file "~/.config/emacs/modes/column-marker.el")

(load-file "~/.config/emacs/modes/web-mode.el")

;; Install a custom mode line
(load-file "~/.config/emacs/mode-line.el")

;; Finalize things
(load-file "~/.config/emacs/finalize.el")

;; Some custom tools
(load-file "~/devel/magit-review/magit-review.el")
(load-file "~/devel/org-diet/org-diet.el")
(load-file "~/.config/emacs/dustycloud.el")

;; Load colors and theme things
(load-file "~/.config/emacs/colors.el")

;; Because I load different font sizes on different computers
; (set-default-font "inconsolata-12")
(set-default-font "mono-9")
#+END_SRC

You can include whatever modes you want.  But let's face it, people
who aren't me will probably just pick and choose from this repo.
Which makes sense!

Anyway, maybe it's useful to you, maybe not.

You shoulda received a [[file:./gpl3.0.txt][copy of the GPL]] with this repository, but if

It's a bit more complicated because some of this stuff is snippets I
took from emacswiki and other sources around the web.  It should be
all GPLv3+ but uh...

Oh yeah, a couple of cool sources if you want to look into more stuff.
Lots of this stuff borrowed from these places...
